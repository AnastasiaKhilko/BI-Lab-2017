1.  Set name in GIT
	git config --global user.name "Name Surname"

2.  Leave meaningful comments for your commits (no games, please!)
	[labwork #1-9 (#1-9 of version)] text comment
		- for hometasks
		- please, set the number of task, which is the same as number of topic
		- in case of multiple commits set the number of version
		- leave text comment (e.g. uploaded the report, modifications in report)

3.  Folders structure (currently only for REPORTS directory, other rules for DWSO folder):
	reports
		Task 01 (the number must correspond to the Topic number)
			Task 01 report.docx
		Task 02
			Task 02 report.docx
			(you can also create SCRIPTS folder here if necessary and put your code there)
	
	Don't generate reduntant files and folders in your working directory, keep it clean. Create PERSONAL forlder if you want to store any additional data in your directory

4.  Please, consider the size of screenshots
	Try to match the font sizes of your document and font size in screenshot (or at least visible with 90% zoom in MS Word)
	And, please, do not paste the screenshots of your full screen

5.  In your report use the same structure as in Labwork document (navigation should exist)
	You may also leave the task in your report (but distingish them by different colors)

6.  Check your grammar: Word helps you by blue/red underscores
	Try not to use street slang like wanna, gonna, yo man, etc.
